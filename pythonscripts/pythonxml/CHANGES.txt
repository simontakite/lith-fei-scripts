Example   File
-------   -----------------

* Chapter 3

 3- 3     c3/handlers.py

          The import shown in the first line of the example should be
          from the xml.sax.handler module, not XML.sax.handler (the
          entire module name should be lower-case).

 3- 4     c3/index.py

          The __init__() method of the Index class should be indented
          two spaces.

 3- 6     c3/saxthumbs.py

          The os module should be imported; add "import os" at the
          top.

 3- 8     c3/genxml.py

          There are two problems with the example as printed.  The
          first is that the code assumes that the character "'" will
          not be present in the method signatures read from the PyXML
          sources; PyXML has evolved such that this is no longer
          correct.  Both "'" and '"' are used in defining default
          values of optional arguments, and can appear in the method
          signatures.  This means that more elaborate quoting of the
          signature lines is needed when using them as attribute
          values in the generated XML.  The function quoteattr() has
          been added to the example file to support this; if you are
          using PyXML 0.7 or Python 2.2, a stronger version of this
          function is defined in the xml.sax.saxutils module.

          The second problem involves some careless string tests in
          the line that starts 'elif line.find("def") > 0'; see the
          example file for the corrected conditions.

 3- 9     c3/handlers.py

          The startElement() method of the  PyXMLConversionHandler
          should not print to standard output; the print statement can
          simply be removed.

* Chapter 7

 7- 5     c7/xpHandlers.py

          The new_element_type() method should use two separate print
          statements to avoid printing lines that are too long.  The
          output displayed in the book matches the corrected version
          of the method.

* Chapter 8

 8- 4     c8/post.py

          The example uses a hardcoded IP address and directs you to
          change it to something more appropriate for you; the file
          changes this to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), which you should not
          need to change.  (Using the string "localhost" sometimes
          fails on some platforms, such as Windows.)

* Chapter 10

10- 2     c10/CustomerProfile.py

          Toward the end of the insertProfile() method, there is a
          raise statement which attempts to raise
          exception.Exceptions; the correct name for the exception is
          simply Exception.

10-12     c10/XMLSwitchHandler.py

          In the processXMLMessagePost() method, the "rezult" variable
          is set twice on two consecutive lines; the first can be
          safely removed.

          In the echoResponse() method, the value of the size
          attribute of the <font> element written at the end of the
          method should be enclosed in single quotes rather than
          double quotes.

10-15     c10/sp.py

          In the doLogin() function, at the start of the long try
          block, the getAttributeNS() DOM method is passed an empty
          string as the namespace URI; this should be None for the
          latest versions of the DOM implementations.
