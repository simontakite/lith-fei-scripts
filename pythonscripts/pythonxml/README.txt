Package date:  18 Dec 2001


This package contains the example files from our book, Python and XML,
published by O'Reilly & Associates.  We hope that making these files
available for you helps as you learn about working with XML with
Python.

These files contain a few minor corrections to the samples as printed
in the book, primarily to correct minor typos which appear in the
first printing of the book, and others remove small bits of code that
proves unnecessary.  There are a few places where spelling corrections
in comments have been made, and minor inconsistencies in the use of
whitespace have been made more consistent; these are not detailed.

There is at this time one larger change that reflects the continuing
evolution of the XML tools available for Python.  The code in the book
was correct and sufficient at the time it was written, but changes
have become necessary as the tools evolved.

A complete list of differences between these files and the printed
book is contained in the file CHANGES.txt.  The file MANIFEST.txt
contains a table showing how the examples in the book relate to the
files in this package.
