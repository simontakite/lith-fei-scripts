<P>Greetings, if you haven't logged in, please take a minute
   to do so.  This site is personalized, and your personal
   information along with special offers are made available
   thanks to our XML processing infrastructure built and
   powered by Python.  This web site dispatches little XML messages
   to and from an XML Switch.  This swith directs the XML message
   to the right resource, submits the message to the handler, and
   then returns the XML back to this web site.  The XML can then
   be displayed to you as profile information and special offers.

<P>
